# web-development-quiz

A fun little website that tests your knowledge on web development! [Link to Website](https://blockdoyle.github.io/web-development-quiz/)

## Overview

This website has a quiz that has beginner level questions to test the user. It uses object arrays to stroe the question and then a 'for loop' loops through all the qestions. When all of the questions have been answered, the webpage will present a text input form that asks for the user's name. When submitted, it is put in localstorage and displayed in the highscore-window.

The highscore-window can be displayed by clicking on the "Highscore" text at the top-left of the page.
